# Fallgate

Fallgate is a game my friend [Cooper](http://schmidlak.com/) and I made as a
hobby project. It is a 2D pixel-art adventure game about questing through a
forest, vanquishing blops and eating doughnuts.

We co-designed the game and the levels. Cooper did the art and animations, and I
did the programming, sounds, and music.

You can play the game online (desktop only, Chrome optimal) at:
