# Tools

I build and open-source small tools as I work. I don't consider any of these significant enough to be considered a 'project' on its own.

I enjoy documenting code and writing guides (as funny as that may sound) so each tool should have enough information on its Github page to get someone up-and-running using it. For any questions, comments, improvements, bugs or the like, please use the 'issues' tab on the relevant project's Github page.

The following are listed chronologically, most recent first.


## py-pomdp
A small tool to parse POMDP environments and policies, load them into Python objects, and provide methods for belief updates and accessing data.

</table>


## git-checker
Check to see if there are uncommitted or unpushed changes locally in any git repos. This is useful if, like me, most of your code lives and is backed up on GitHub, and you want to make sure things are up-to-date and pushed in case of a hard drive failure.

## beautyplot
![A picture of a matplotlib plot, post-beautyplot](/data/projects/programming/tools/beautyplot_with.png)
A single function call to make `matplotlib.pyplot` plots look better. Because neither `prettyplotlib` nor `matplotlibrc` worked for me.

## org
A GTD-inspired, Bootstrap-enabled, super-light project management system. Write up your projects and resources in Markdown, host and view locally in a browser on your Mac (with Apache/PHP).

I use this tool heavily to keep track of all of my personal projects, but would like to move beyond Apache and PHP, so I plan on releasing a new tool based on this written as a Node.js app in early July 2014.
