# Tools

I build and open-source small tools as I work. I don't consider any of these
significant enough to be considered a 'project' on its own.

I love documenting code and writing guides (nerd!) so each tool should have
enough information on its Github page to get someone up-and-running using it.
For any questions, comments, improvements, bugs or the like, please use the
'issues' tab on the relevant project's Github page.

The following are listed chronologically, most recent first.

## py-pomdp

A small tool to parse POMDP environments and policies, load them into Python
objects, and provide methods for belief updates and accessing data.

## git-checker

Check to see if there are uncommitted or unpushed changes locally in any git
repos. This is useful if, like me, most of your code lives and is backed up on
various git servers (GitHub, GitLab, ...) and you want to make sure all your
stuff is pushed in case your computer goes AWOL.

## beautyplot

![A picture of a matplotlib plot, post-beautyplot](/data/projects/programming/tools/beautyplot_with.png)
A single function call to make `matplotlib.pyplot` plots look better. Because neither `prettyplotlib` nor `matplotlibrc` worked for me.

## org

A GTD-inspired, Bootstrap-enabled, super-light project management system. Write
up your projects and resources in Markdown, host and view locally in a browser
on your Mac (with Apache/PHP).

I used this tool heavily to keep track of all of my personal projects.
Eventually I wanted to move beyond Apache and PHP and try something new, so I
wrote a newer version using node.js. The code and data are tied together right
now so I haven't open-sourced it yet.
