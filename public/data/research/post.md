## Bio

![A picture of me!](/data/other/max_cropped.jpeg)

I am a second-year PhD student in artificial intelligence at the University of
Washington. My advisor is [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/).
I am in the [UW Natural Language
Processing](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp/people) group.

My current research focuses on: (1) machine learning approaches to commonsense
knowledge acquision, (2) grounded language work in computer vision and robotics.

I am supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
