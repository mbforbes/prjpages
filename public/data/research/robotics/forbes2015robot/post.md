## Abstract
Robot Programming by Demonstration (PbD) allows users to program a robot by demonstrating the desired behavior.
Providing these demonstrations typically involves moving the robot through a sequence of states, often by physically manipulating it.
This requires users to be co-located with the robot and have the physical ability to manipulate it.
In this paper, we present a natural language based interface for PbD that removes these requirements and enables hands-free programming.
We focus on programming object manipulation actionsâ€”our key insight is that such actions can be decomposed into known types of manipulator movements that are naturally described using spatial language; e.g. object reference expressions and prepositions.
Our method takes a natural language command and the current world state to infer the intended movement command and its parametrization.
We implement this method on a two-armed mobile manipulator and demonstrate the different types of manipulation actions that can be programmed with it.
We compare it to a kinesthetic PbD interface and we demonstrate our method's ability to deal with incomplete language.
