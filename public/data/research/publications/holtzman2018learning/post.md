## Abstract

Despite their local fluency, long-form text generated from RNNs is often
generic, repetitive, and even self-contradictory. We propose a unified learning
framework that collectively addresses all the above issues by composing a
committee of discriminators that can guide a base RNN generator towards more
globally coherent generations. More concretely, discriminators each specialize
in a different principle of communication, such as Griceâ€™s maxims, and are
collectively combined with the base RNN generator through a composite decoding
objective. Human evaluation demonstrates that text generated by our model is
preferred over that of baselines by a large margin, significantly enhancing the
overall coherence, style, and information of the generations.
