## Bio

![A picture of me!](/data/other/max_cropped.jpg)

I am a first-year PhD student in artificial intelligence at the University of
Washington (UW). I am in the [UW Natural Language Processing](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp/people) group. My advisor is [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/).

I am broadly interested in artificial intelligence, especially natural language
processing and robotics. My current research focuses on the extraction and
application of commonsense knowledge.

I am supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
