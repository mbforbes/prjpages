## Research

I am a first-year PhD student in artificial intelligence at the University of
Washington. My advisor is [Yejin
Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/).

I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligence, including natural language
processing, robotics, machine learning, and computer vision. Specifically, I
aim to explore a machine learning-driven approach to situated language
understanding, linking natural language processing with grounded tasks in
robotics and computer vision.

As an undergrad, I worked with [Maya Cakmak](http://www.mayacakmak.com/), [Luke
Zettlemoyer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/), and [Rajesh P. N.
Rao](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rao/).

After graduating, I worked for a year in the [Human-Centered Robotics
Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/humancenteredrobotics/), spending most of my
time with Rosie, the resident PR2.

I then worked for a year a software engineer at Google on the open-source
project [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) as well as [Google Container
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/).

## Projects

My non-academic project interests include:

1. Programming: data visualization, games, web programming
1. Music composition and performance (I play jazz sax and piano)
1. Clothing modification (this one is nascent)
