## Projects

0. Programming: data visualization, games, organization
0. Music composition and performance
0. Clothing modification

## Research

I previously worked as a research aide at the [University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering Department](http://www.cs.washington.edu/). I was extremely fortunate to work with [Maya Cakmak](http://www.mayacakmak.com/), [Luke Zettlemoyer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/), and [Rajesh P. N. Rao](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rao/). I spent most of my time in the [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/humancenteredrobotics/) with Rosie, the resident PR2.

I'm broadly interested in artifical intelligence, and specifically at the intersections of:

0. Natural language processing
0. Robotics
0. Machine Learning


## Current

I work as a software engineer at Google on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/kubernetes) and [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/).
