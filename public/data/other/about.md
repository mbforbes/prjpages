## Projects

Here are my main non-academic project interests:

0. Programming: data visualization, games, organization
0. Music composition and performance
0. Clothing modification

## Research

I currently work as a research aide at the [University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering Department](http://www.cs.washington.edu/). I am extremely fortunate to work with [Rajesh P. N. Rao](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rao/), [Luke Zettlemoyer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/), and [Maya Cakmak](http://www.mayacakmak.com/). I spend most of my time in the [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/humancenteredrobotics/) with Rosie, the resident PR2.

I'm broadly interested in artifical intelligence, and specifically at some intersection of:

0. Robotics
0. Natural language processing
0. Machine Learning
