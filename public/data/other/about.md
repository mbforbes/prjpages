## Projects

My non-academic project interests include:

0. Programming: data visualization, games, life-tracking apps
0. Music composition and performance (I play jazz sax and piano)
0. Clothing modification (this one is nascent)

## Research

I previously worked as a research aide at the [University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering Department](http://www.cs.washington.edu/). I was extremely fortunate to work with [Maya Cakmak](http://www.mayacakmak.com/), [Luke Zettlemoyer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/), and [Rajesh P. N. Rao](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rao/). I spent most of my time in the [Human-Centered Robotics Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/humancenteredrobotics/) with Rosie, the resident PR2.

I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligence, including natural language processing, robotics, and machine learning. A bit more specifically, I aim to explore a machine learning-driven approach to situated language understanding, linking natural language processing with robotics.

## Current

I work as a software engineer at Google on the open-source project [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) as well as [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/).
