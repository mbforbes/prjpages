## TODO:
* simple path matching (express)
* launch
* make heroku commands to compile bootstrap and generate sass so that I don't track them. currently tracking that I don't want to:
  * public/css/bootstrap.min.css
  * public/js/bootstrap.min.js
  * public/fonts/*
  * public/css/pt_prj.css

## Notes:
* My phone's screen width is 360px, so that should be the minimum resolution width supported (if not smaller...)
